**The book (and its source) is organized into three parts:**

*Part I - Apache Thrift Overview*

A high level inroduction to Apache Thrift and its architecture. Examples from this part are hello worldish.

/part1

*Part II - Programming Apache Thrift*

This part digs into each layere of the Apache thrift framework, examining transports, protocols, servers and the Apache Thrift interface definition language in detail. Examples from these chapters use C++, Java and Python as the demonstration languages.

/part2

*Part III - Polygot Application Development*

This part covers a set of the most popular platforms and languages used with Apache Thrift. The Web, Mobile, and backend systems are examined through the lense of C++, Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, C#, ObjectiveC and Ruby. The general idea is to add jump starts for every Apache Thrift language over time, though only the above mentioned languages will be in the first edition of the book.
